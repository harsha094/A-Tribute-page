    <h3 id="title">Most Interesting facts about Founder and CEO of Apple </h3>
    <li><strong>Steve jobs was adopted</strong></li>
      <p>Steve Jobs was born on, February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, to Abdul Fattah Jandaali a Syrian Muslim immigrant and Joanne Schieble, an American graduate student. His biological father, grew up in Syria, and met his biological mother at the University of Wisconsin.  At the age of 23, they both thought, it was too young to marry, and having a child out of a wedding, was unconventional, and not a trend in those days. so they gave their baby, to Steve’s adoptive parents, Paul, and Clara.  They agreed to raise Steve, on the promise that he would go to college.</p>
    <li><strong>He didn't like firing people especially after he had kids</strong></li>
      <p>After Steve Jobs had children, he found it much more difficult to fire people. Here's what he said, according to the book: "When I look at people when this happens, I also think of them as being 5 years old, kind of like I look at my kids.

And I think that that could be me coming home to tell my wife and kids that I just got laid off. Or that it could be one of my kids in 20 years. I never took it so personally before."</p>
    <li><strong>His last words are still a mystery</strong></li>
      <p>Steve Jobs final words were monosyllables that he repeated thrice “Oh wow.  Oh wow.  Oh wow”.  The reason behind this utterance is still a mystery.</p>
    <li><strong>He was a Zen Buddhist</strong></li>
       <p>In 1974 after working with electronics and video game company, Atari, Jobs travelled to India for 7 months in search for spiritual enlightenment. He meditated often, and was a known pescatarian - eating fish but not meat. He also liked to walk barefoot.</p>
    <li><strong>He was into fish and veggies</strong></li>
       <p>Steve Jobs was a pescetarian and his favourite food was fish. He also liked carrots and fruits and spent some time as a fruitarian, meaning he only ate fruits, nuts, seeds, vegetables, and grains.</p>
    <li><strong>He didn't like doing commencement speeches</strong></li>
       <p>Steve Jobs was a family man. He looked forward to coming home every day to have dinner with his wife and children.

There are two main reasons he decided to deliver the commencement speech at Stanford University in 2005 — it wasn't very far from his home, so he didn't have to travel and be away from his family.

And he respected Stanford for its rich history of producing tech influencers, according to Schlender and Tetzeli's book.</p>
    <li><strong>He was a college dropout</strong></li>
        <p>Steve Jobs was a college dropout and attended Reeds College for just 18 months. He continued his education by informally auditing classes. In Reeds, the course that attracted him the most was calligraphy. He used to audit calligraphy classes, which famously went on to influence the typography and font of Apple products.</p>
    <li><strong>He followed a simplistic dress code</strong></li>
        <p>His signature dressing style included a black turtleneck, jeans, and sneakers. He was known for his simplicity with the turtle neck and Levis jeans. It is said that he had close to 100 Levis jeans throughout his lifetime.</p>
    <li><strong>He met his biological sister at 27</strong></li>
        <p>The famous author Mona Simpson is his biological sister, who he tracked down later in life.  Her first novel, Anywhere but Here, was about her relationship with her parents, who were Steve Job’s biological parents as well.</p>
    <li><strong>He was bullied</strong></li>
        <p>In the sixth grade, Steve attended at Crittenden Middle School where he was bullied for allegedly being odd. This resulted in Steve giving his parents an ultimatum - he would drop out of school if they didn't move. So, they moved to Los Altos in California (the birthplace of Apple) where he met fellow engineer Bill Fernandez, who introduced him to Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak.</p>
    <li><strong>He was fired from Apple</strong></li>
        <p>Jobs was fired because Pepsi Executive John Sculley told the board that he was far too young. This was after Jobs recruited him. Jobs then started another project creating the NeXT computer, but sales were limited because it was too expensive.

Apple purchased NeXT stock resulting in Steve returning to Apple.

There is a silver lining to this story - the combination of NeXT hardware with Apple resulted in operating systems like iOS used for the iPhone.</p>
    <li><strong>Hewlett Packard offered Jobs a summer job</strong></li>
        <p>When Jobs was 12 HP founder Bill Hewlett offered him a summer job after Steve called him asking for parts for an electronics project. It was known that Jobs had a keen interest in engineering from a young age as he used to help his guardian, Paul, fix things on his workbench.</p>
    <li><strong>He made Google change the yellow gradient in its "O"</strong></li>
        <p>Jobs called the former VP of Google, Vic Gundotra, and told him that second O in Google had the wrong shade of yellow and that he was going to fix it. Evidently, Steve had incredible attention to detail.</p>
    <li><strong>He patented all his inventions</strong></li>
        <p>Steve Jobs had close to 300 patents under his name. The glass staircase at the Apple store is one such patented attraction that pulls passers-by into the store.</p>
    <li><strong>He was one of the youngest people to make the Forbes list</strong></li>
        <p>Steve Jobs' success meant that he made it on a number of Forbes lists. He was number 17 on most powerful people in 2010, 39 on the Forbes 400 rich list in 2011, and 110 on Billionaires in 2011.</p>
  </ul>  
  </br>
  <strong>Lastly I would like to leave you with one amazing quote said by Steve Jobs</strong>
     <blockquote>
       <p>“You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.”</p>
